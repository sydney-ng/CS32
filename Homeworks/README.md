# Homeworks 
Description of the following work in this folder: 

## Homework 1: 
In this homework, we will demonstrate the difference between deep and shallow copy of objects.
Are able to initialze, create, and delete objects using constructors and deconstructors. We use both public and private functions & variables to demonstrate the 
different aspects of objects. 

## Homework 2: 
In this homework, we will analyze the difference between stacks and queues to solve a maze. Using a queue, selections are processed using FIFO (first in first out), while 
stack selection is done using LRU (Last Recently Used) to find a solution.  

## Homework 3: 
We look at tree structures and examine how they are built and processed. We then will see how inheritance can be used for objects to reduce duplication of code, overwrriting over
parent functions, and how construction & deconstruction work for these types of classes. 

## Homework 4: 
We examine function overloading as a way to reduce code duplication, look at the the manner in which operators are used, and trace how function complexity depeding on the type of data structures that we choose (and how complexity increases as functions get more and more copmlex).
