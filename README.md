# UCLA's Computer Science 32 - Algorithms and Data Structures

### Professor: David Smallberg
### Quarter: Spring 2018

What is covered below is the fundamental data structures and their use in programming. This includes both class design and features of the C++ programming language.
Projects and Homeworks are built around the design and use of the C++ standard library (STL). By using the standard library, we can show master in the ability to 
write reasonably sophisticated programs quickly.

## Skills Demonstrated 
1) Demonstrate strong problem solving skills in constructing complete C++ programs to tackle exercises inspired by real-world problems.
2) Analyze the performance of algorithms and data structures.
3) Select and use the most appropriate data structure from the C++ standard library (STL) for a particular programming task.
4) Design and implement efficient customized data structures.

# Homeworks 
Description of the following work: 

## Homework 1: 
In this homework, we will demonstrate the difference between deep and shallow copy of objects.
Are able to initialze, create, and delete objects using constructors and deconstructors. We use both public and private functions & variables to demonstrate the 
different aspects of objects. 

## Homework 2: 
In this homework, we will analyze the difference between stacks and queues to solve a maze. Using a queue, selections are processed using FIFO (first in first out), while 
stack selection is done using LRU (Last Recently Used) to find a solution.  

## Homework 3: 
We look at tree structures and examine how they are built and processed. We then will see how inheritance can be used for objects to reduce duplication of code, overwrriting over
parent functions, and how construction & deconstruction work for these types of classes. 

## Homework 4:
