# Projects
Description of the following homeworks:

## Project 1:
In this project, we work with constructors, which are special member fucntions that initialize instances of a class. Destructors do the opposite and will de-initialize 
an instance of a class. It takes no parameters. Dynamic memory usage is used to allocate memory as needed. Operators `new` and `delete` are used to manage this memory. 
Assignment operators, copy constructors, and default constructors are examined in this project. 

## Project 2:
In this project, we examine how linked lists work by creating, interfacing with, and deleting linked lists. We use nodes to keep track of the head of the linked list, determine the 
values stored in each node, and iterate until we reach the end of the linked lists. We also examine maps and upsert values to it (depending on the change in the value). 

## **Project 3:**  _Featured Project_
This project is the largest project of the quarter and examines how inheritance, polymorphism, subclasses, and base classes are used in object oriented programming. Each character in the created
game is derived from a base class object. We will write both private and public functions to implement the interface for each subclass. This shows how objects can take
on many different forms (as when a parent class is referenced by a child class object). 

## Project 4:
In this project, we learn about security and how hashes (algorithms that aim to produce a unique, fixed-length string), tokenizers (which convert input text to streams of tokens, where each token is a separate word, punctuation sign, 
number/amount, date, e-mail, URL/URI, etc.), and decryption (the conversion of encrypted data into its original form) can be implemented using C++.
